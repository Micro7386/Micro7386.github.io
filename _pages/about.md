Hi! Thanks for visiting my homepage!  

I am Wang Yushen, a third-year undergraduate student majoring in communication engineering at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Weidong Mei](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/meiweidong/zh_CN/index.htm) from [National Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications](https://www.ncl.uestc.edu.cn/), UESTC. Currently I am looking for graduate programs (Master's or Ph.D.) of Fall 2026 in broad areas related to wireless communications, artificial intelligence and robotics.
