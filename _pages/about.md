Hi! Thanks for visiting my homepage!  

I am Wang Yushen, a third-year undergraduate student majoring in communication engineering at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Weidong Mei](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/meiweidong/zh_CN/index.htm) from [National Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications](https://www.ncl.uestc.edu.cn/), UESTC.  

My research interests lie in wireless communications, particularly Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC), near-field communications (NFC), movable antennas (MAs), extremely large multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) as well as AI for communications.
